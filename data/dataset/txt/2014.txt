ABSTRACT:Characteristics of gas products during temperature-programmed pyrolysis of three grades bituminous coal were studied using thermogravimetric-mass spectrometric (TG-MS) analysis. The effects of pyrolysis temperature, heating rate and coal grade on gas yield and generation regularity were investigated. The experimental results indicated that the devolatilization index decreases with the increasing of heating rate, and it is beneficial to products release. However, the reaction time was shortened and the gas yield was reduced. The generating curves of hydrocarbon gases shown one single peak shape, but the generating curves of other gases were irregular. Hydrogen and Hydrocarbons generated from different coals has the same tendency of ionic strength with temperature, and also has similar peak temperatures. The gas yield of different coals was related to the composition of raw coal. Meanwhile, the form of sulfur was different in different coal samples, and it mainly release in the form of H2S, SO2 and COS.

ABSTRACT:Yimin lignite and Datangwujianfang lignite, two kinds of Chinese lignite, were selected for the investigation. In the work, the drying process of the lignites, which particle size were 3mm-20mm, was investigated in a self-designed fixed-bed dryer and the fine particle (0mm-3mm) lignite drying process was carried out in a downward vertical tube dryer. The drying mechanism of a single lignite particle was discussed based on the temperature curves of the flue gas and the surface of lignite particle. The results indicate that the drying process of lignite is greatly influenced by the initial flue gas temperature, particle size and initial moisture content. The water emission can be promoted by the increase of the initial flue gas temperature and the lignite devolatilization can be avoided even under the initial temperature of 800℃. The increases of particle size and initial moisture content can prevent the lignite devolatilization. Both the two kinds of lignite keep stable during the drying process in the downward vertical tube dryer. The water absorption and dewatering characters of Yimin lignite are more rapid than those of Datangwujianfang lignite. Meanwhile, compared to Datangwujianfang lignite, Yimin lignite is easier to pyrolyze. Therefore, high-temperature flue gas drying process is suitable for lignite dewatering.

ABSTRACT：For the development of dense phase transport gasification technology, lignite (YN), sub-bituminous (SD) and bituminous (NM) coals were pyrolyzed in a drop-tube furnace. A digital image particle analyzer was used to obtain both swelling ratio and sphericity simultaneously. The effects of coal rank, particle size, temperature and drying pretreatment on char morphology were studied. With the increase of coal rank, the swelling ratio and sphericity were both increased. YN lignite underwent an obvious shrinkage with swelling ratio about 0.66 after the 1273K pyrolysis. SD sub-bituminous and NM bituminous were more than 1. The particle sphericity was increased after pyrolysis because of the softening. With the increase of pyrolysis temperature, the swelling ratio of NM coal decreased, and the sphericity increased first and decreased then. Finer NM coal particles resulted in higher swelling and roundness. The swelling ratio of dried NM coal chars were higher, and increased with a higher pyrolysis temperature, which is contrary to the raw coals with moisture. The variation of sphericity with temperature was similar to the raw coal but the sphericity of dried coal char was lower than the raw coal. Drying pretreatment before pyrolysis experiments could significantly influence the morphology of chars.

ABSTRACT：Mass flowrate regulating valve of coal powder has been widely used in entrained-flow pulverized coal gasification plants and plays an important role in the regulation of coal mass flowrate. The performance of the imported regulating valve in Anqing Shell Coal Gasification Plant was tested. The test results showed that the pulverized coal flowrate was significantly sensitive to the valve opening while it was below about 20%. When the valve opening was more than 40%, the valve became almost ineffective in regulation. Meanwhile, its pressure drop characteristics in both conveying loop process and gasifier feeding process of pulverized coal were also analyzed. Based on the performance studied, the optimization for the gasifier feeding operation was suggested.

ABSTRACT：The flow of syngas and the temperature distributions of three sections of heating surface and three circular gaps for convective waste heat boiler under the two kinds of ambience (CO and H2, CO2 and N2) are studied respectively by numerical simulation methods. The results show that under two kinds of ambience, the velocity fields are similar; the residence time of discrete phase in the boilers are identical; under two kinds of ambience, the changing laws of heat transfer coefficient varying with the circular gap and three sections of heating surface are the same. The heat transfer coefficient under CO2 and N2 ambience is bigger than that under reducing ambience; under two kinds of ambience, heat transfer distribution is different, which leads to big difference in temperature field. The different temperature distribution caused by different ambience will contribute to different arrangement of the heating surface in the boiler. Therefore, the article provides the reference to the design of safety and high efficiency of convective waste heat boiler under two different ambience.

ABSTRACT：The experiments on the co-gasification of corn straw and lean coal with steam-oxygen-carbon dioxide mixture were carried out in the fixed bed gasifier. The effects of straw proportion，reaction temperature and the oxygen concentration(OC) on the gas composition and low heat value (LHV) were investigated. The results show that the straw in the samples promote the production of CO and hydrocarbon and suppress the production of H2, however, excessive straw can reduce the gas content and LHV. The gas content of CO and H2 reach their maximum when the straw percentage reaches 0.2 and 0, respectively. The LHV reaches the maximum at the straw percentage of 0.2. The increase of temperature can promote the co-gasification and improve the gas content, but excessive temperature suppress the production of CnHm. By increasing OC, the gas content and LHV are improved. LHV reaches the maximum when the OC comes to 0.2. The mixing of CO2 in the enriched gas can improve the gas content and save cost.

摘要：利用两段固定床对三层床煤依次经过450℃低温、650℃中温和900℃高温的分级热解过程进行模拟实验，研究了上两段中低温和下两段中高温热解相邻两段之间的相互作用，揭示了多层床煤热解提高油气品质的机理.通过中低温热解的相互作用，焦油中轻质组分(沸点低于360℃的馏分)含量增加，热解气中CH4含量增加，H2含量减小，说明中低温热解主要通过半焦对热解产物的原位催化提质作用而提高焦油品质.通过中高温热解的相互作用，焦油收率和焦油中轻质组分含量增加，CH4和CO含量升高，H2含量下降，表示中高温热解的主要作用是在富含H2气氛下热解提高焦油收率和品质.实验结果表明，多层床煤热解主要通过半焦的原位催化提质和富H2气氛的协同作用而提高热解油气品质.

ABSTRACT：A two-stage fixed bed reactor was used to simulate the three-stage bed pyrolysis of coal for implementing the pyrolysis successively at low, medium and high temperatures of 450℃, 650℃ and 900℃.  The interaction of pyrolysis reactions between two adjacent stages, i.e. between the low- and medium-temperature pyrolysis in the upper two stages and between the medium- and high-temperature pyrolysis in the lower two stages, was investigated to reveal the mechanism of improvement on the quality of tar and gas for multi-stage bed pyrolysis of coal.  It was found that the interaction between the low- and medium-temperature pyrolysis increased the light fractions in tar (boiling points below 360℃) and CH4 content in gas, while it decreased the H2 content in the gas.  This indicates that the tar quality improvement via the interaction between the low- and medium-temperature pyrolysis in the upper two stages is mainly due to the in-situ upgrading of tar catalyzed by char.  The interaction between the medium- and high-temperature pyrolysis increased the tar yield and light tar fractions, while it elevated the CH4 and CO contents and decreased the H2 content in the pyrolysis gas.  These show that it is the H2-rich atmosphere that improved the yield and quality of tar by the interaction between the medium- and high-temperature pyrolysis.  As a consequence, the multi-stage bed coal pyrolysis realized mainly the in-situ upgrading of tar under catalysis of char and the H2-rich atmosphere of pyrolysis that can improve the quality of the pyrolysis oil and gas.

摘要：为了研究煤粉粒径对煤快速热解半焦特性的影响，对微负压系统中煤快速热解产生半焦的收率、灰分、挥发分含量和结构等特性进行了分析.结果表明，随着粒径增加，煤粉热解的活化能逐渐增加，低温区大粒径煤粉热解挥发分逸出量高于小粒径煤粉逸出量.热解半焦收率随着煤粉粒径减小逐渐增加，挥发分中焦油收率却随着煤粉粒径的减小而增加.小粒径煤热解生成的半焦结晶程度较低，边缘碳原子和其他缺陷较多，半焦炭层结构较不致密.极小颗粒中矿物质含量较高导致煤粉粒径越小，所得半焦的灰分含量越高，大粒径煤粉由于在低温区间失重速率快，挥发分逸出量大而导致半焦中残余的挥发分含量较低.

ABSTRACT：In order to investigate the effects of particle size to characteristics of semi-coke from the coal pyrolysis process, the characteristics of semi-coke including yield, ash content, volatile content, and structure were studied. The results shows that the activation energy increased with coal particle size, and the volatile emission from large particle coal pyrolysis was higher than that from little particle coal pyrolysis in low temperature. The semi-coke yield always decreased with the increase of particle size, while the coal tar yield decreased with the increase of particle size. The structure of semi-coke from little particle coal pyrolysis was not fine and close due to low degree of crystallinity. The ash content of semi-coke from little particle coal pyrolysis appeared increasing with the decrease of particle size due to more mineral substance in little particles, while the volatile content of semi-coke from large particle coal pyrolysis was lower caused by more volatile emission during pyrolysis process.

ABSTRACT：The coking coal blending technology of stamp-charging coke oven was studied using different species of coking coal. According to the requirement of metallurgical coke, the reasonable coal blending scheme was investigated. Based on this，coke which is accorded with the characteristic of coke ash and sulfur content, the broken and abrasion Strength, coke reactivity (CRI) and coke strength after reaction (CSR) will be available.

ABSTRACT：With a coal extract as precursor, four kinds of carbon materials (named FKC600, FKC700, FKC800, FKC900) used for supercapacitor electrode were successfully prepared by using carbonization method at 600℃,700℃,800℃,900℃ under the protection of nitrogen, respectively. The pore structure of as-obtained carbon materials were characterized by hypothermia nitrogen adsorption.The electrochemical properties of supercapacitors with carbon materials as electrodes were studied by using galvanostatic charge-discharge and  cyclic voltammetry techniques. The results showed that, with carbonization temperature increasing, the specific surface area and total pore volume of the four carbon materials increased gradually, but the overall pore structures were underdeveloped. The specific surface area of the FKC600 and FKC700 only reached about 14·g-1. Four carbon materials in 3mol/L KOH electrolyte had a good charge-discharge reversibility, behaved a typical double layer capacitance. The volumetric specific capacitance and area capacitance first increased and then decreased with carbonization temperature increasing. The volumetric specific capacitance of FKC700 reached up to 112.4F·cm-3, the area specific capacitance of FKC600 and FKC700 were more than 800μF/cm2 much higher than the theoretical storage limit of carbon materials.

摘要：使用不同酸、碱溶液对堇青石蜂窝陶瓷载体进行了预处理，考察了载体酸、碱预处理对蜂窝状Fe-Mo/ZSM-5催化剂涂覆率及NOx催化还原性能的影响，并采用XRD，NH3-TPD和扫描电镜等技术对蜂窝状催化剂表面形貌、结构特征和表面酸性进行了分析.结果表明，载体经酸性和碱性溶液预处理后，蜂窝状催化剂的涂覆率和催化能力都提高，且酸溶液预处理的效果要优于碱溶液预处理.分析认为，这与酸溶液作用下堇青石结构受到一定程度的破坏，表面变得粗糙以及所制备的蜂窝状催化剂表面较多的弱酸位有关.

ABSTRACT：In this paper, cordierite honeycomb carriers were pretreated by different acid and alkaline solutions to prepare Fe-Mo/ZSM-5 monolithic catalysts. The effect of pretreatment method on the coating rate and performance of the monolithic catalyst was studied. Meanwhile, the surface character, structure and surface acidity of the monolithic catalyst were analyzed by XRD, NH3-TPD and SEM techniques. Results showed that acid and alkaline pretreatment can both increase the coating rate and the catalytic performance of the monolithic catalyst, and the catalyst pretreated by HCl performed best. It is believed that this result can be contributed to the effect of acid solution, which can modify the cordierite surface and change the surface acidity of monolithic catalyst.

ABSTRACT：The effect of iron-based catalysts such as Fe(NO3)3, FeCl3 and (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 prepared by impregnation method on the hydropyrolysis behavior were investigated using a fixed-bed reactor in this paper. The role of catalyst, (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2, having the highest yield of tar was investigated, and its tar was evaluated. The results showed that coal hydropyrolysis conversion was improved after adding these three catalysts; adding (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 of 5%, the tar yield increased from 14.3%(daf) without catalysts to 17.9%(daf). Adding different valence iron catalyst, the role of iron catalyst is different. The existence of ammonium root is conducive to the improvement of coal pyrolysis conversion and tar yield. The tar prepared from (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 has a good quality compared with that prepared without catalyst, its quality greatly improved.

ABSTRACT：The primary issue of automatic coal petrography using image analysis method is to determine the relationship between gray value of images and the reflectance. A theoretical approach was made to analyze the relationship followed by experiments using standard materials. The suitable illumination conditions were also studied. Finally comparisons of working curves and precision between image analysis method and microscope photometer method were conducted. A linear correlation and a high degree of linear correlation coefficient had been found between gray value of images and the reflectance by both theoretical and experimental methods. The degree of linear correlation was close to 1 in a wide illumination range and the smaller the field stop was, the better the degree of linear correlation. The precision of image analysis method could match that of the traditional one.

ABSTRACT：The slag as catalyst was added to the fat coal in Pengcheng with different blending ratios, and cokes were then prepared from these blended coal samples. The thermal properties of coke were tested, and X-ray diffraction, SEM analysis and liquid nitrogen absorption were carried out. It was shown that the CO2-gasification reactivity of the resulting cokes significantly increased with the increase of the addition of slag, and their reactivity was enhanced at a maximum. Also, with the same addition, the smaller the size of the slag is, the higher the coke reactivity index is. However, the post-reaction strength of the coke decreased with the increase of the addition of slag. The ash and sulfur of cokes increased with the increase of the addition of slag but there was a point for the sulfur. And the coke directional degree got worse and the degree of cyclic condensation become smaller with the increase of the addition of slag. And the surface area of cokes increased at first and then decreased with CRI increase. The EDS study showed the compounds of Fe and Ca were evenly distributed in the coke, which enhanced the CO2-gasification reactivity and degraded the strength of the coke texture.

ABSTRACT：The coal characteristic to the application feasibility of the cogeneration technology was studied, based on a 1 kg/h scale pyrolysis results of three low-rank coals with different degree of metamorphism. It was found that the characteristic of chars was similar to that of bituminous coal after pyrolysis. Using of char blends as boiler fuels, the boiler efficiency increased than using raw coal blends and the increasing became more notably as the decrease of the coal metamorphism. In addition, the pyrolysis product, low-temperature coal tar will create substantial economic value for the power plant. The tar yield increased as the increase of the volatile content and the H/C ratio. However, the high water content in the coal will decrease the tar yield per unit and thus the economic feasibility decreased.

摘要：以烟煤和高粱秸秆为研究对象，在小型加压固定床反应器上考察了压力3.5 MPa及温度700 ℃条件下制焦方式、煤/生物质混合比和气固接触时间对煤与生物质共气化制取富甲烷气体过程中水蒸气气化反应和甲烷化反应的影响.结果表明，对于水蒸气气化反应，煤焦和生物质焦共气化时不能观察到明显的协同作用；对于甲烷化反应，高粱秸秆焦的甲烷化反应活性高于煤焦的甲烷化反应活性，当对高粱秸秆水洗后，高粱秸秆焦的甲烷化反应活性降低至与煤焦的甲烷化反应活性相当，分析表明，水洗后高粱秸秆焦碱金属钾的含量显著降低，说明高粱秸秆焦中碱金属钾的存在是高粱秸秆焦甲烷化反应活性较高的主要原因.增加气固接触时间，有利于提高甲烷产率.

ABSTRACT：The Inner Mongolia coal and sorghum straw around Taiyuan, Shanxi Province were selected as the samples in this study. The effect of char preparation method, coal/biomass blend ratio and gas residence time were tested on steam gasification reactions and methanation reactions in a fixed bed reactor under the pressure of 3.5 MPa and the temperature of 700 ℃. The results showed that no synergistic effects were observed on steam gasification reaction when co-gasification of coal char and sorghum straw char blend. The catalytic activity of sorghum straw char on methanation reaction is higher than that of the coal char, however, the catalysis of sorghum straw char is equivalent to coal char after wash with water. Analysis showed that the alkali metal potassium content was significantly decreased after water wash. The relation between the methanation activity and potassium amount in biomass showed that the potassium in biomass played the key catalytic effect during methanation reactions. The increase of residence time of gas in the dense zone of the gasifier has significance on the increase of methane yield.

摘要：采用共沉淀-水热复合法制备Ni-Mg/Al2O3催化剂，考察焙烧和还原温度对其结构和甲烷化催化性能的影响，通过XRD，H2-TPR，TEM等表征，发现随焙烧温度升高，催化剂中NiAl2O4物相呈增多趋势，至900 ℃时，催化剂中镍物种完全以NiAl2O4形式存在，催化剂表面积从500 ℃焙烧的130 m2/g降至900 ℃焙烧的34 m2/g.针对600 ℃焙烧的催化剂，反应活性随还原温度升高呈现先增加后降低的趋势，其最佳还原温度为650 ℃，这主要是受Ni物种还原度、还原后Ni晶粒尺寸等多重因素影响.通过关联甲烷化性能与催化剂结构发现，NiO与载体之间相互作用适中，还原后表面能够形成较小的镍晶粒，催化剂具有较好的甲烷化活性和稳定性.

ABSTRACT：Ni-Mg/Al2O3 catalyst for syngas methanation was prepared by an approach combining co-precipitation and hydrothermal methods. The effect of calcination and reduction temperatures on catalyst structure and performance for methanation were investigated by activity evaluation and catalyst characterization using X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed H2 reduction (H2-TPR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and so on. The results showed that with the increase in calcination temperature the reduction of the catalyst become more difficult because of the formation of NiAl2O4 at high temperatures, especially at temperatures above 900 ℃. The specific surface area of the catalyst decreased from 130 m2/g to 34 m2/g corresponding to the calcination temperatures rise from 500 ℃ to 900 ℃. After calcination at 600 ℃, the stability and catalytic activity of the catalyst first increased and then decreased with raising the reduction temperature, and the best methanation performance appeared at a reduction temperature of 650 ℃. This is due to the differences in the reductive degrees of nickel compounds and in the grain sizes of resulting Ni. It demonstrates actually the relationship between the catalytic performance for methanantion and the structure of the Ni-Mg/Al2O3 catalyst. This study clarified that for good catalytic performance of methanation, the grain size of Ni should be small and the interaction between active metal (Ni) and catalyst supporter (Al2O3) should be moderate.

ABSTRACT：In this work, three different metamorphic grade undeformed coals (Ro,max=0.38%-1.06%) and three different deformation type coals(weak-brittle deformed coal, strong-brittle deformed coal and strong-ductile deformed coal)were compared, evolution characteristics of hydrogen from gaseous products on different metamorphic grades and deformation types deformed coals were explored during pyrolysis. The results show that there is a definite difference in the transgression amount of H2 with the increasing temperature during the pyrolysis of the three undeformed coals(SGT01,JZT01 and WY01), but there is little difference on the accumulated generation of H2 during their pyrolysis. At the same temperature, there are obviously differences during the emission of three deformed coals, it is obviously that the generation amount of H2 of strong-ductile deformed coal(XTM10) and strong-brittle deformed coal(XTM07)are less than that of weak-brittle deformed coal(XTM09). It is clearly that the generation amount of H2 of strong-ductile deformed coal(XTM10) also less than that of strong-brittle deformed coal(XTM07).

ABSTRACT：In this paper, pyrolysis of the coal (Pingshuo) behavior was investigated in the fixed bed reactor under different reactive atmosphere. The effect of pyrolysis temperature and heating rate on tar, water, char yields and desulfurization rate was studied. The results indicated that methane can produce large amounts of CHx groups in the presence of a catalyst. The CHx groups made the radicals produced by the pyrolysis of coal more stable, and then improved the tar yield. The higher tar yield can be obtained when Pingshuo coal pyrolysis was integrated with the atmosphere of CH4/CO2（catalyst）. In the pyrolysis temperature of 600 ℃, the tar, water and char yield and desulfurization rate were 33.5%, 25.8%, 69.5% and 25.3%(mass fraction) respectively under the atmosphere of CH4/CO2（catalyst）, which was 1.6 and 1.8 times as that under H2 and N2, respectively.

ABSTRACT：Pyrolysis experiments for pine sawdust, undried lignite and their blending samples were performed in a tubular furnace. The results showed that the gas yields increased gradually, while liquid and solid yields reduced with the increase of pyrolysis temperature when pyrolyzed separately. High temperature was beneficial to the rapid evaporation of the moisture in lignite, and promoted the steam reforming reaction of pyrolysis product and water vapor. The addition of pine sawdust adjusted the proportion of carbon and hydrogen and promoted the pyrolysis of lignite. When the pine sawdust proportion was 30%, the difference value of the carbon conversion rate and gas generation rate between experimental value and calculated value reached to the maximum. It showed that the synergy effect behaved significantly in this condition.

ABSTRACT：The co-pyrolysis of carboniferous high sulfur coal from Weibei with white straw was presented. The effects of the pyrolysis temperature, heating rate, holding time, mix ratio of coal and biomass and pressure on the desulfurization of organic sulfur and its desulfurization law were investigated by the orthogonal test. FTIR and SEM were employed to analyze structure characteristics and pore properties of the semi-coke. The effects of low temperature extractions on the desulfurization of co-pyrolysis with biomass were introduced. The results show that the effect of pyrolysis temperature on desulfurization rate is significant. The best desulfurization conditions are 850 ℃, 15 ℃/min, 15 min, 1∶4 and 2 MPa. Pore structure of co-pyrolysis semicoke presents with a degree of regularity, thin walls, and relative large diameters, which benefits the release and spread of sulfur during co-pyrolysis. The desulfurization rates of co-pyrolysis are increased by low temperature extractions, especially for the hot water refined coal. Its co-pyrolysis desulfurization rate is about 39%.

ABSTRACT：The changes in O-containing functional groups and surface hydrophilic property due to hydrothermal treatments under different conditions were examined in this paper using Shengli lignite. The results showed that the increases in reaction temperature, reaction time and and initial pressure could promote the removal of O-containing functional groups to different extents. The maximum removal rate of the methoxy, carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl were 67.88%, 89.41% and 93.70%, respectively. The contact angle of the coal samples (with water) increased after the removal of O-containing functional groups, which was a direct reflection of  weak hydrophilic property on coal surface. The linear fit analysis demonstrated that the contact angle has a better correlation with carboxyl than other functional groups, implying strong affinity between carboxyl and water due to the formation of hydrogen bond.

ABSTRACT：The lignite drying process of a 600 MW oxy-fuel combustion power plant was simulated by Aspen Plus software. The effect on drying characteristics of drying medium, temperature, flow rate and the concentration of CO2 and H2O in flue gas were investigated. The simulation results show that the flue gas of oxy-fuel combustion is suitable for lignite drying. CO2 in the flue gas can effectively prevent spontaneous combustion of lignite which make drying process more safety; CO2 can increase the drying capacity of flue gas, while H2O in the flue gas will inhibit evaporation of moisture in the coal; the increase of drying temperature and flow rate will accelerate lignite drying to achieve the requirements, while effect of the drying temperature is more obvious. According to the simulating results, temperature of 150 ℃ and flow rate of 1.4×106 m3/h are the best drying conditions for the 600 MW oxy-fuel combustion power plant.

ABSTRACT：In this paper, the coal blending were obtained by mixing Fugu coal (A) with Shenmu West Ditch coal (B) and Shenmu River coal (C) in different proportion, respectively. Fugu coal has high ash melting point, while Shenmu West Ditch coal and Shenmu River coal have low ash melting point. The ash was produced by calcining in muffle furnace. The temperatures of melting characteristic of the ash in the weak reduction atmosphere were measured by JRHR-3 microcomputer ash melting point apparatus. The changes of the mineral composition in the ashes of the coal blending which were obtained in different proportion and at different temperatures were analyzed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and CaO-SiO2-Al2O3 three phase diagram. The experimental results show that coal blending can effectively improve the fusibility of ash melting. The ash melting point of coal blending and the proportion of coal blending have a non-linear relation. The change of the ash melting point of the coal blending is mainly due to the transformation of minerals at high temperature.

ABSTRACT：In this study, water hyacinth was pre-treated using a ball mill and then the pre-treated water hyacinth, Shenfu coal, water and dispersant were used to prepare water hyacinth-coal slurry (WHCS) proportionately. The slurry ability and rheological properties of WHCS were investigated, which were also compared with coal-water slurry(CWS). The results showed that the yield stress, thixotropy and stability of WHCS were found to be much higher than that of CWS. But the absolute value of the zeta potential of WHCS was smaller than that of CWS. With increasing ball milling time, the WHCS slurry ability was enhanced, the yield stress was obviously decreased, thixotropy and stability was slightly weakened, while the zeta potential absolute value was increased.

ABSTRACT：In this paper, formed coke with excellent quality was successfully prepared by briquetting pyrolysis technology, in which low rank coal and direct coal liquefaction residue (DCLR) were adopted as main raw material and additive separately. The composition and structure of formed coke were characterized by FTIR and SEM, and the effect of the proportion of DCLR on the compressive strength of formed coke was investigated. The results indicated that formed coke’s compressive strength increased first and then decreased with the proportion increase of DCLR. The compressive strength reached its maximum 573.3 N/ball as the proportion of D-DCLR increased to 40%, which was mainly attributed to the proportion increase of both the ash and colloidal matter.

ABSTRACT：Activated carbons were prepared from Taixi anthracite. KCl was used as additive in this study. The preparation process is under the following procedures: mixing, extruding, carbonization and activation. The properties of the carbons were characterized by CO2 adsorption capacity, iodine number, specific surface area and pore size distribution (PSD). The capacity of CO2 adsorption was independent of iodine number, specific surface area and total pore volume. Further studies show that the CO2 adsorption capacity of the activated carbon has great relevance with the PSD. In order to find the optimum pore size for CO2 adsorption, the pore size was divided into different ranges which were fitted with the CO2 adsorption capacity by linear regression analysis through the excel software, and the relationship between the PSD and the CO2 adsorption capacity was investigated. The result showed that the CO2 adsorption capacity of activated carbon has great relevance with the pore volume between 0.61 nm and 0.79 nm and to increase the pore volume is a vital way to increase the CO2 adsorption capacity.

ABSTRACT：This paper intends to study the optimum culture condition of coal fermenting to produce hydrogen when interacted under the conditions of glucose, pH, dosage of coal and concentration of Fe2+. Based on the testing of which Fe2+, pH and glucose were used as single factors, by means of range analysis principle, a four-factor interactional experiment was designed and the data was collected by response surface method, in which glucose, pH, dosage of coal and concentration of Fe2+ were the response factors and gas production was the response value. The results show that glucose and pH both have a notable impact on hydrogen production respectively, and the interaction between pH and Fe2+ works significantly as well, whereas the effect of dosage of coal is not very obvious. The experiment bears out that under the conditions that the dosage of glucose is 6 g/L and the original pH is 5.5, and the dosage of coal matrix is 50 g/L and FeCl2·4H2O is 10 mg/L, the hydrogen production effect is best and up to 24.26 mL/g, which provides an advantageous reference for the large-scale industrialized experiment.

ABSTRACT：The pulverized coal’s effects on the modifying and concentrated dewatering of sludge was explored by the method of gravity concentrated dewatering. The results showed that the dehydration property and the sedimentation property of the sludge have been improved greatly through adding pulverized coal into the sludge. When 10 g of pulverized coal was added to 100 g of sludge, the moisture content of concentrated sludge was reduced to 76.35% from 91.13% after modified treatment. The average sedimentation rate of sludge was increased to 1.73 mL/min from 1.30 mL/min. There are differences in the modifying and concentrated dewatering of sludge through adding different particle sizes of pulverized coal, the optimum particle size of the pulverized coal for sludge modifying is 0.076 mm-0.25 mm. With the increase of the pulverized coal’s dosage, the concentrated dewatering performance and the mechanical dewatering performance of sludge are more improved. The moisture content of concentrated sludge is less than 80% through adding pulverized coal into the sludge, which provide conditions for using the concentrated sludge mixed with coal to prepare the sludge-coal water slurry. The results have important theoretical and practical significance for the resource utilization of the sludge.

ABSTRACT：The interaction of oxygen-containing functional groups and moisture in lignite is very complicated. This experiment utilizes different solutions including sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid and hydrogen peroxide to modify the lignite. The congelation characteristics of water in modified samples were studied by DSC instrument. The change of chemical structure in modified samples was characterized by FTIR. The results of DSC showed that the bound water and free water in lignite modified by sodium increased; the congelation of water in lignite modified by hydrochloric acid was basically the same as raw coal. The free water was reduced and the bound water almost disappeared after modified by hydrogen peroxide. The results of FTIR show that the increase of functional group —OH is the main reason for the bound water and free water in lignite increased.

ABSTRACT：The drying processes of two types of lignite in Mengdong area with different coal rank were discussed in this paper, and  lignite samples which were dried to different degree were analyzed as well. It was found that lignite samples with different coal rank had relatively identical drying rate variation trend, while the coal rank had certain impact on drying rate. The Wulagai lignite, which has lower coal rank，could be dried at relatively higher drying rate and reach the maximum drying rate earlier compared with Baorixile lignite. Moreover, drying process changed the micromechanism of lignite, and the specific surface area of lignite which had lower moisture content after drying was bigger than raw coal’s. Along with the decrease of moisture content during drying process, the amount of oxygen functional groups in lignite declined firstly, and grew up then. Compared with Baorixile lignite, the amount of oxygen functional groups in Wulagai lignite increased earlier in drying process, which made it more easy to be oxidized.
