摘要：通过超声萃取的方法，采用苯、二硫化碳（CS2）和四氢呋喃（THF）三种溶剂对山东金源气煤的四种不同煤体结构煤（原生结构煤、碎裂煤、碎粒煤和糜棱煤）进行了分级萃取，结合元素分析、工业分析以及柱层析法，对煤样的化学组成和族组成进行了测试.结果表明，随着变质程度的增加，溶剂萃取率有增大的趋势；溶剂萃取作用下，C元素和H元素含量增加，S元素和O元素含量减小，这种变化趋势主要是煤中主要元素相对含量变化的体现；随着煤体破坏程度增加，气煤萃取物中的总烃含量增大，非烃类含量减小，与无烟煤呈现相反的变化趋势；尽管煤体结构不同，但各煤样的不同溶剂萃取物的族组分相对含量均呈现一致性的对比关系.

ABSTRACT：By means of the fractional extraction method assisted by ultrasonic vibration, four gas coal samples with different deformation degree from Jinyuan coalmine, Shandong province extracted by three solvents, including benzene, carbon disulfide(CS2) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) under the condition of room temperature, and further the group compositions and chemical compositions of coal samples were measured by column chromatography method, ultimate and proximate analysis method. The results show that the extraction rate shows the increasing trend with the increasing of the deformation extent of coal body structure; under the effect of solvent extraction, the content of element C and H increase but that of element S and O decrease. The tendency is mainly caused by the change of the relative content of each element; as the deformation degree of coal body structure increases, the content of total hydrocarbon increases but the content of non-hydrocarbon decreases in the extracted gas coal. It shows the opposite trend of anthracite with different deformation degree. Although the coal body structure is different, the relative content of group composition of different solvent extraction in each coal sample shows a consistency tendency.

ABSTRACT：The existence forms of the water contained in the two kinds of the lignites from Inner Mongolia, China were investigated by the methods of low temperature differential scanning calorimetry and constant temperature drying. The results show that the lignites contain the water with three different congelation characteristics, free water, bound water and nonfreezable water and the content of three waters is closely related to coal type. It is also found that the drying rate of the free water is much greater than that of the bound water. According to the existence form and congelation characteristics of the water contained in the lignites, it can be inferred that Datang Wujianfang lignite possess a larger ratio of micropore volume to total volume than that of Xilingol lignite and the ratio of micropore volume of the Chinese lignite is larger than that of Australia lignite. Meanwhile, it is verified by the porosity analyzing result that the ratio of micropore volume of Datang Wujianfang lignite is greater than that of Xilingol lignite and the result is consonant with the change in the congelation characteristics of the water contained in the lignite.

ABSTRACT：In order to investigate the influence of flue gas temperature and particle size, an experiment was carried out to obtain the drying features of lignite particles at different initial gas temperature (600 ℃-900 ℃) and particle size (10 mm-25 mm). It was found that the falling-rate drying period was the main drying period. And the influence of flue gas on the drying was less significant during the high temperature (600 ℃-900 ℃) compared with the low temperature. Specific to the lignite drying process feature of water migration and pore characteristics, this kinetics model that the reducing of water was mainly resulted from evaporation out of coal particles drying was established on the basis of Knudsen diffusion law, and the effective diffusivity coefficient (De) of different flue gas temperature was calculated. At the same time, the activated energy for the moisture diffusion of different particle size(10 mm-25 mm) were calculated by applying Arrhenius type relationship.

ABSTRACT：The product distributions of co-pyrolysis of biomass and coal are closely related to the operation conditions. Low-temperature co-pyrolysis of Eichhornia crassipes and low-rank coal blends were undertaken in a special fixed bed reactor by way of orthogonal experiments to explore the optimal way and improve the yields of pyrolysis oil. The results show that the logical progression of factors are as follows: final temperature＞proportion＞particle diameter＞heat preservation time. The maximum yield of pyrolysis oil is 11.70% when the EC ratio is 35%, the final temperature is 550 ℃, the particle diameter of EC is 0.355 mm-0.500 mm and the heat preservation time is 25 min, which increased by 3.36% compared with before. After optimization, the content of benzene reaches 63.17% supported by GC-MS, which rise by 81.99%. Ultimate analysis and heat value analysis indicates that there is little or no variation in n(H)∶n(C) and heat value of pyrolysis oil. The yield of pyrolysis oil has been increased without impairing the quality.

(Key Laboratory of Condition Monitoring and Control for Power Plant Equipment, Ministry of Education, North China Electric Power University, 102206 Beijing)
ABSTRACT：A comparison of two pathways on NO desorption reaction between the nitrogen-containing char edge model in armchair configuration and O2 was explained in this paper based on Mayer bond order theory and transition state theory at the molecular level. To release intermediate HCN firstly in the char combustion process was the first pathway for the formation of NO. Another pathway was to release NO from the reaction with O2 directly. The reaction energy and energy barrier of every step in the two pathways were calculated. The results show that the model’s Mayer bond orders of N2—C4 and C1—C3 are minimum so that it can extract HCN when the two bonds break. The energy barrier for this process to overcome is 451.671 kJ/mol. On the other hand in the process of direct oxidation to produce NO it can be found that the Mayer bond order of C1—N2 is minimum when the model’s Mayer bond order is calculated. NO can be desorpted in the end when the bond is break. The energy barrier from M1 to M2 to overcome is 259.81 kJ/mol. The energy barrier from M2 to NO is 133.1 kJ/mol. Therefore, the second pathway, which is to generate NO directly by the reaction between O2 and the selected char edge model, is relatively easy.

ABSTRACT：This paper presented the preparation of L-tar (light coal tar) fractions in a low temperature coal tar from Shanbei by vacuum distillation. Seven fractions containing <100 ℃, 100 ℃-170 ℃, 170 ℃-200 ℃, 200 ℃-240 ℃, 240 ℃-270 ℃, 270 ℃-300 ℃ and 300 ℃-340 ℃ were isolated. The composition and distribution of fractions were characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results show that about 95%(mass fraction) of coal tar is obtained at 340 ℃ fraction. Fat hydrocarbon compounds are distributed in each fraction. Anthracene phenanthrene compounds are mainly enriched in 170 ℃-240 ℃ fraction. Low-boiling phenols are concentrated in the fraction of <100 ℃, and the content of phenols is about 45%, in which the contents of phenol and cresol are 7.46% and 13% respectively. High-boiling phenols were mainly distributed in 100 ℃-170 ℃ and 170 ℃-200 ℃ fractions. A few of low-boiling phenols and olefin are found in 270 ℃-300 ℃ and 300 ℃-340 ℃ fractions, may be caused by the thermal decomposition of long-chain alkane and high-boiling phenols at high temperature.

摘要：首先利用热重法考察了氧解耦化学链燃烧(CLOU)中CuO载氧体在不同氧气气氛以及不同温度等工况下的释氧特性、Cu2O在不同温度下的吸氧特性以及CuO载氧体的持续循环能力.最后采用Achar-Brindley-Sharp-Wendworth方法对氧化铜在不同氧气浓度下的动力学参数进行了拟合求解.结果表明，CuO释氧速率随反应温度的提高而增加.氧气浓度越高，CuO在释氧温度区间的活化能大幅增加，因此开始析出氧气的温度也越高.对于Cu2O，温度越高，反应后阶段的吸氧速率越快.经过20次循环，CuO的释氧吸氧能力逐渐降低.

ABSTRACT：The oxygen uncoupling and absorption properties of CuO oxygen-carrier for chemical-looping with oxygen uncoupling (CLOU) process were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), including oxygen uncoupling properties under different oxygen partial condition, different heating rates, different temperatures and oxygen absorption properties of Cu2O at different temperatures. Then the resistance abilities were also tested in TGA. At the latter part of the paper, dyramic parameters of the CuO carrier were put into calculation and analysis applying Achar-Brindley-Sharp-Wendworth equation. According to the research results, it is found that the oxygen uncoupling rate was faster at higher reaction temperatures. And the oxygen uncoupling temperature rises with the increase of oxygen concentration, which is evidenced by the increasing apparent activation energy of CuO. As for Cu2O, oxygen absorption rate seems to be faster when temperature increases. In addition, the oxygen uncoupling and absorption properties of CuO oxygen-carrier decreases with the increasing cycle numbers.

ABSTRACT：The effect of additives on the combustion characteristic and ash melting temperature of Chongqing Nantong high ash content bituminous coal under O2/CO2, O2/N2 atmosphere was studied by the thermogravimetric-differential analyzer and ash melting point tester. The experimental results show that CaCl2, Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3 can effectively enhance the activity of pulverized coal response surface and reduce the temperature of coal reaction activation energy, the igniting and the burnout. And these additives can improve coal combustibility index C and burnout index Cb as well. The ability of promoting effects is CaCl2＞Ca(OH)2＞CaCO3. CaCl2 can increase the heat quantity of unit pulverized coal, and improve the combustion efficiency of pulverized coal. Additive Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3 can significantly reduce the ash melting temperature, and increase the possibility of coal ash slagging. Therefore, CaCl2 has good comprehensive performance and it is an effective additive for inferior coal combustion.

摘要：以石槽村煤泥为主要原料进行冷压成型制备型煤，采用单因素实验和正交实验等方法，重点研究黏结剂掺比和配煤比对型煤质量的影响.结果表明，添加少量的A或D黏结剂即可使型煤具有良好的冷压强度.配煤比和D黏结剂掺比是型煤质量指标的主要影响因素，D可与煤粒固化形成高强度的型煤“骨架”，但会增加型煤灰分，降低其发热量；配入原煤可提高煤泥型煤发热量，降低灰分，但会降低型煤强度.煤泥单独进行成型时，较优的黏结剂配方为：A掺比5%或D掺比4%；配煤成型时，以配煤比为8（煤泥）∶2（原煤）、D掺比7%为宜.

ABSTRACT：A briquette was prepared with Shicaocun coal slime by cold-pressed process, single factor and orthogonal experiments were adopted to study the effect of the ratio of binder and coal blending on the briquette quality. The results show that adding a small amount of binder A or D could make the briquette having good cold strength. The ratio of coal blending and binder D were the main factors of briquette quality, high strength briquette “skeleton” could be cured with binder D and coal particles, but the briquette ash content increased and the calorific value reduced. Blended with raw coal would increase the coal slime briquette calorific value and reduce its ash content, but it also will reduce the briquette strength. Forming with coal slime, the optimum formulation was 5% binder A or 4% binder D. Forming with slime and raw coal, the appropriate ratio of coal blending was 8(slime)∶2(coal) and 7% binder D.

ABSTRACT：A demonstrative experiment of 4 t/h coal-fired boiler is applied to make a burning test that using five kinds of coals, monitored the air pollutants emission in different conditions of coal property, and calculated the air pollutants emission coefficients of different coals. The results showed that under the same conditions, the boiler’s air pollutants emission is different to five kinds of coals. The produce concentration of dust smoke is between 328.86 mg/m3 and 3 634 mg/m3 while its emission concentration is from 30.26 mg/m3 to 72.91 mg/m3, the output of dust is 0.7 kg/h-11.7 kg/h and the emissions is 0.07 kg/h-0.31 kg/h. The formation concentration of SO2 is from 199 mg/m3 to 3 565 mg/m3 with the production of 0.83 kg/h-16.21 kg/h, its emission concentration is between 69 mg/m3 and 1 443 mg/m3 while its emissions is 0.34 kg/h-7.51 kg/h. The formation concentration of NOx is from 173 mg/m3 to 336 mg/m3 with the production of 0.75 kg/h-1.521 kg/h, while its emission concentration is between 159 mg/m3 and 371 mg/m3 with the emissions of 0.67 kg/h-1.93 kg/h. Generated concentration of SO3 at 0.000 4 mg/m3-0.001 5 mg/m3 and its emission concentration is 0.000 15 mg/m3-0.000 93 mg/m3. The experimental results also indicate that the concentrations of dust and SO2 are individually mainly related to ash content of coal and sulfur content of burning coal, but the concentration of NOx isn’t relevant to nitrogen content of coal. In addition, the discharging coefficients of SO2 and NOx are similar with national survey of pollution sources coefficients, while the dust emission coefficient is smaller.

ABSTRACT：To study the effect of temperature, drying degree and atmosphere on lignite oxygen-containing functional group and moisture absorption during low-temperature drying, the type and content of oxygen-containing functional group was determined by IR and chemical titration, and moisture absorption characterized by moisture holding capacity. The results showed that the content of carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl were high in lignite. Phenolic hydroxyl content kept constant, and a small amount of carboxyl decomposed during low-temperature drying at an inert atmosphere. While, when drying at air atmosphere, the content of carboxyl and phenolic hydroxyl increased in consequence of oxidation. With the deepening of drying, MHC of lignite decreased and then increased.

ABSTRACT：The heat of immersion of Baorixile lignite and its 500 ℃ pyrolysis semi-coke were measured at 25 ℃ in water by μRC micro-calorimeter. The results show that the heat of immersion of semi-coke does not depend on particle size, and the rate of immersed heat release increases with decreasing particle size. Moisture content has substantial influence on the heat of immersion of lignite or semi-coke: no immersed heat release is observed when the moisture content of lignite is more than 16%. When the moisture content of dry coal was less than 16%, the heat of immersion of dry coal increase with decreasing moisture content. The heats of immersion of fresh semi-coke are smaller due to oxidation and moisture adsorption. After 48 h exposure, the heat of immersion of oxidative semi-coke is lowered to 50% of that of fresh semi-coke. The heat of immersion drops to 12% of that of fresh semi-coke after 240 h exposure and remains this level under longer exposure time beyond 240 h. The lignite and semi-coke exhibit significant differences in surface functional groups, which are shown to account for the difference in heat of immersion.

摘要：在50 L高压釜上研究了不同反应条件对煤与催化裂化油浆共处理反应压力变化的影响.结果表明：在400 ℃，H2气氛和5.0 MPa(室温)条件下，使用Mo系列催化剂时，体系总压力最低，压降最多而且压力下降时温度最低；使用Fe系列催化剂次之；无催化剂时结果相反.说明Mo催化剂加氢性能最好.油浆与煤投料比例对压力的变化规律影响不明显.随反应温度的升高，压力增加.在低温400 ℃保温段，反应1 h压力不回升，延长反应时间到3 h压力也不回升，但压降主要发生在保温前期.在高温425 ℃和450 ℃保温段，压力随反应时间的延长会回升，可能是发生缩聚反应所致.温度越高，缩聚越严重.气氛对反应影响较大.N2气氛下，在保温段压力一直增加，可能是缩聚反应产生小分子所致.

ABSTRACT：In 50 L autoclave, pressure variation was studied at different reaction condition for coal and FCCS(fluid catalytic cracking slurry) co-processing. The results show that compared with Fe catalyst and without catalyst, reaction system has lowest reaction pressure and the highest pressure fall when using Mo catalyst. In addition, reaction temperature is lowest using Mo catalyst. Fe catalyst is the next. It shows that Mo catalyst is the better catalyst than Fe. The ratio of coal and FCCS doesn’t show obvious effect on reaction pressure. But reaction temperature shows the important effect on reaction pressure. When reaction temperature is at 400 ℃, pressure always decreases with reaction time, but with the increasing of reaction temperature, the pressure firstly decreases and then increases. The reaction time with pressure fall decreases with the increasing of reaction temperature. The pressure is always increases at constant reaction temperature under N2 atmosphere which result from polycondensation reaction.

ABSTRACT：Using high temperature coal tar and long flame coal as the main raw material, the paper studied the hydrogenation reaction characteristics of coal processing with tar, and evaluated the pyrolysis properties of coal and high temperature coal tar by TG experiment. Using 500 mL mechanical agitator autoclave experiment, the internal pressure changing under different reaction temperature was studied and the reason was analyzed. The results showed that the internal pressure had the same change trend under different reaction temperature and the reaction was mainly divided into rapidhydrogenation reaction, equilibrium cleavage reaction and speed reducing condensation reaction three stages. The experiment studied the effect of hydrogen distribution changing before and after hydrogenation on the hydrogen donor capacity. The results showed that high temperature coal tar structure altered obviously after prehydrogenation as the content of Hα and Hβ improved. The coal tar performed better as hydrogen donor and promoted the hydrocracking reaction so that the oil yield increased 2% through autoclave experiment validation.

ABSTRACT：To study the waste heat recovery effect of coke oven gas (COG), two kinds of spiral jacketed pipes at different diversion angle are used in 4.3 m high coke oven’s ascension pipes to test the temperature fluctuation and averaged heat transfer effect of COG. It shows that the temperature of COG fluctuate periodically with coking time. The maximum temperature can reach 825 ℃ and the temperature fluctuation of coke oven gas mainly affect the heat transfer capacity, but less affect the averaged heat transfer coefficient. When the volume flow of nitrogen is 190 m3/h and the temperature of N2 input is 30 ℃, the havg (average heat transfer coefficient) of 91# ascension pipe(diversion angle 4°) is 30.23 W/(m2·℃) and the havg of 92# ascension pipe(diversion angle 3°) is 25.2 W/(m2·℃). The heat transfer model was derived as the flow characteristic of COG and structure of experiment device. The prediction of the model matches the experimental data well, and the maximum relative error is controlled within ±20%.

ABSTRACT：The gasification reaction behaviors of metallurgical coke and semi-coke were investigated by simulating the conditions of blast furnace. The microstructures of semi-coke were tested by SEM and LOM in order to explain the mechanism of reaction. It is shown that the beginning reaction temperature of semi-coke was low. The reaction rate of semi-coke was much higher than metallurgical coke, which increased quickly with the reaction temperature increasing. After alkali-rich, the alkalis could get into the inside of semi-coke, which lead to high reaction rate of semi-coke for long time. The microstructures of coke are compact which contains lots of mosaic textures. However, the microstructures of semi-coke which contains lots of isotropic texture are lamella in shape that resulted in large specific area. Therefore, the semi-coke was easy to react with CO2 at high temperature.

ABSTRACT：The test of oxidation of SO2 under the effect of fly ash and pure oxide particles were conducted in a wet flue-gas desulfurization system. And different affecting factors including water temperature and oxygen concentration have been considered synthetically. The results indicate that the main elements in fly ash are Si, Al, Fe, and Ca etc.. And the main forms are SiO2, CaO, Fe2O3, Al2O3, mullite and plagioclase. The degree of SO2 oxidation has increased greatly when fly ash was added into the mixed gas. Regardless fly ash the degree of SO2 oxidation increase obviously with the increase of water temperature, but the increasment decrease. When there is no fly ash in the mixed gas, the degree of SO2 oxidation will increase greatly with the increase of oxygen concentration. However, the influences will disappear when the fly ash exist. The comparative results of experimental values and calculated values show that there are synergies between different oxides.

摘要：利用沉降炉燃烧系统，研究了五种冶金工业废渣对三种典型的烟煤燃尽率及氮氧化物释放的影响，并对添加剂的助燃机理进行了初步探讨.结果表明，煤种对于添加剂的催化性能起着重要作用，添加剂催化作用的大小和添加量有关，添加量并不是越大越好.在本实验范围内，钢渣适用于较低变质程度的烟煤；脱硫渣对于三种煤均有一定的催化助燃作用，但对于燃尽率的增幅都不是很大；锰尾矿适用于低变质程度的烟煤；铬渣适用于较高变质程度的烟煤.添加剂的加入能够影响煤中氮氧化物的释放，煤种和添加剂的添加量都能够对添加剂的脱硝效果起到重要的影响作用.通过对燃烧残余物的电镜扫描，发现加入废渣后燃烧产物颗粒外观由平整变为不规整的蜂窝状；此外，X射线衍射分析发现添加剂改变了燃烧残余物的组成.

ABSTRACT：Taking Naomaohu coal as research object, raw coal (RC) was divided into three solid products, which were residue (RD), deposit (DP) and soluble (SL), using high temperature and pressure extraction apparatus. The effects of the coal addition, temperature, coal particle size and solvent type on the extraction yields of SL and DP were investigated. Proximate and ultimate analysis, TG-DTG and FTIR analysis were determined. The results showed that when the dosage of solvent was certain, with the amount of coal adding, the yield of DP increased, the yield of SL decreased slightly; temperature increase promoted extraction of SL and DP, and at higher temperature than 375 ℃, the yield of SL increased rapidly because of large pyrolysis reaction; coal particle size had little influence on extraction; tetralin and 1-MN choosed as solvents, the total yield of SL and DP was similar, which was higher than that choosed toluene as solvent. Hydroxyl substance and aliphatic hydrocarbon contents of RC were mainly collected in SL and DP, ash content was mostly collected in RD, the moisture content of RD, DP and SL was far below that of RC.

ABSTRACT：The structural characteristics of vitrinite and inertinite were studied using FTIR experiments in combination with subsection peak separation method and structural parameters contrast. The results of subsection peak separation: vitrinite and inertinite have something in common in the distribution of hydroxyl type, but different for proportion of every hydroxyl type; vitrinite is characterized by higher CH2, CHx and C=O proportions as well as lower R3CH, C=C and —O— proportions than inertinite; the mode of distribution of aromatic hydrogen of inertinite is more than that of vitrinite, suggesting more relative complicated substitution mode of aromatic in inertinite. The results of structural parameters contrast: inertinite is characterized by higher aromaticity and ring condensation index and condensation ratio, as well as lower parameter of degree of oxidation of organic matter, n(Hal)∶n(Har) and aliphatic ratio than vitrinite. It indicates that there are higher degree of aromatization, shorter relative length of aliphatic chain, more abundance of aliphatic branch chain, and lower degree of oxidation of organic matter in inertinite than in vitrinite.

ABSTRACT：This article investigated the changes of surface functional groups of coal and their effect on the activity of coal oxidation by pre-oxidation treatment of anthracite, using TPD-MS, TG-DTA and other characterization methods. The results indicated that oxidant treatment can change the surface functional groups of coal in different degrees. Hydrogen peroxide and sodium hypochlorite treatment have little effect on the activity of oxidation reaction, while the nitric acid treated anthracite has a high low-temperature oxidation reaction activity. According to the variation of coal surface groups, we can infer that oxygen-containing groups in anthracite such as carboxyl significantly improve the low-temperature oxidation activity of coal. The alkyl does not have an obvious effect on low-temperature oxidation activity of coal, but has a certain influence on the coal oxidation reaction heat.

摘要：为研究表面活性剂在氧化煤表面的吸附特性及其对煤表面润湿性的影响，系统考察了溶液温度、初始浓度、溶液pH值和吸附时间对阳离子表面活性剂十六烷基三甲基溴化铵(CTAB) 在氧化煤表面吸附量的影响，研究了吸附CTAB对氧化煤表面润湿性改性的影响.结果表明，提高温度，增大CTAB溶液初始浓度，会增加CTAB在氧化煤表面的吸附量，CTAB溶液pH值在5~7之间时，有利于CTAB与煤吸附过程的进行；氧化煤表面极性含氧官能团的增加明显有利于CTAB在煤表面的吸附.氧化煤吸附CTAB后，接触角随时间变化由急剧减小变为略有下降，平衡接触角由0°变为70°，水分复吸率下降，其表面润湿性发生了明显的由亲水性向疏水性的反转.

ABSTRACT：For the study of adsorption characteristics of surfactants on the surfaces of oxidized coal and its influence on coal surface wettability, the effects of solution temperature, initial concentration, pH value and adsorption time on the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethyl amonium bromide (CTAB) adsorbing capacity on the oxidized coal surface were investigated. The influence of CTAB adsorption on the oxidized coal surface wettability modification was studied. The obtained results show that enhancement of CTAB solution temperature and initial concentration can increase the adsorbance of CTAB on the oxidized coal surfaces. It was observed that the optimum pH value for the adsorption process of CTAB on coal surfaces was range from pH 5 to pH 7. It was proved that the adsorption capacity of CTAB on coal surfaces increased with a rise in the amount of oxygen containing functional groups for all the studied samples. The adsorption of CTAB on the oxidized coal surfaces leads to a very significant change of the contact angle change with time from the sharp decrease into slight decrease, as well as equilibrium contact angle changed from 0° to 70° and moisture re-absorption decline. These changes are attributed to the wettability alteration from hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity of CTAB adsorption on the coal surfaces.

ABSTRACT：The low-temperature pyrolysis of Shangwan coal (particle size 3 mm-6 mm) was studied using TG-FTIR. The results showed that the maximum water loss rate was 1.1%/min-1.2%/min at 130 ℃. Shangwan coal was totally dried from room temperature to 250 ℃ at constant speed of 10 ℃/min. The yield of weight loss increased and severe pyrolysis reaction occurred with the rising of temperature. The release of CO2, H2O, CH4 and light hydrocarbons (LHCs) occurred in the pyrolysis stage. The release yield increased with the increase of pyrolysis temperature. The release of CO existed only in the pyrolysis process of the final temperature of 750 ℃and 850 ℃. The notable release of LHCs appeared before 650 ℃, and the maximum yield of LHCs reached 38.5 mg at 750 ℃, but obviously decreased at 850 ℃ due to the critical thermal polymerization.

ABSTRACT：Three strains (a bacteria named N6, a fungi named M6 and an actinomycete named G1) were cultivated, and an orthogonal biosolubilization test was done with these strains and five different coals.Then,with the method of Pearson test, the correlation between coal biosolubilization, vitrinite reflectance and coal component was analyzed. The results show that the lower vitrinite reflectance is, the better coal biosolubilization is. The more vitrinite and minerals group coal has, the easier to be dissolved. The smaller content of liptinite and inertinite coal has, the better coal solubility is. Especially, biosolubilization of coal is greater influenced by vitrinite reflectance.

ABSTRACT：Based on Aspen Plus simulation software，thermodynamics of carbon deposition was investigated for syngas methanation, and the diagnosis diagram of carbon deposition were obtained. The results show that when the mole ratio of H and O in the raw material is less than 5, the higher the temperature is, the more likely the carbon deposit, and when the ratio is greater than 5, the result is on the contrary. For the raw material that varies in proportion of hydrogen, oxygen and carbon, the effect of pressure on the carbon deposition is different. For Topsoe syngas methanation process, because the compositions of the outlet gas in the starting reactor and the last reactor (the first reactor and the fifth reactor) are at the range of carbon deposition in the corresponding temperatures, it’s probable to deposit carbon, but it can be reduced or eliminated by adjusting the ratio of water vapor.

ABSTRACT：X-ray powder diffractometry, ICP-AES and slag melting property deteminator were used to investigate chemical composition, phase composition, high-temperature phase composition, fusibility and viscosity-temperature characteristics of five kinds of gasification slags, and phase composition evolution and the changes of viscosity-temperature were studied by quenching at high temperature and simulating of FactSage. The results show that the main chemical composition of gasification slags are SiO2, Al2O3, CaO, Fe2O3 and residual carbon. Under high temperature conditions, phases of five different gasification slags vary because of the difference of the chemical composition. As the temperature rises, molten slags are turned into amorphous phase gradually. The measured value and calculated value of slag viscosity are basically consistent, CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 ternary phase diagrams and viscosity-temperature curve drawn by phase diagram of FactSage can be well use to explain the high-temperature phase evolution and viscosity-temperature characteristics of gasification slag.

ABSTRACT：Lignite char-supported Fe and Fe-Cu sorbents for coke oven gas desulfurization by means of ultrasonic method. The effects of temperature and optimal preparation process on their properties during sulfidation were studied. The physical and chemical properties of the sorbents were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), respectively. The results of desulfurization experiments show that ultrasonic-assisted irradiation optimum condition of preparing sorbent are 5 h for ultrasonic impregnation time, 1 h for co-precipitation time and ultrasonic water bath temperature is 50 ℃ (the experimental ultrasonic cleaner power is 100 W), respectively. The char supported iron-based sorbents can simultaneously remove the H2S and COS from coke oven gas with high desulfurization efficiency. As the increased temperature, the desulfurization efficiency and sulfur capacity of the sorbents increased obviously, and the highest sulfur capacity can be reached when the temperature is 400 ℃. Moreover, the addition of Cu into iron-based sorbents can obviously improve desulfurization efficiency.

摘要：利用陕北地区的兰炭末制备水炭浆，研究了兰炭末的粒度配比、制浆搅拌作用及温度对水炭浆表观黏度、流动性和稳定性的影响.兰炭末用实验室球磨机研磨好并筛合成＞830目(D1)，200目~320目(D2)，100目~200目(D3)和60目~100目(D4)四种粒径范围.结果表明，当兰炭末的粒度配比m(D1)∶m(D2)∶m(D3)∶m(D4)=5∶2∶2∶1，搅拌速率为1 500 r/min，搅拌时间为15 min，环境温度为30 ℃～40 ℃时，制备出的水炭浆质量分数可达到60%，表观黏度360 mPa·s，浆体可以保持一个月内稳定并且流动性良好.随着细粒度兰炭颗粒加入量的增加，水炭浆表观黏度增大，流动性变差，稳定性增强.搅拌速率过高和搅拌时间过长会导致浆体老化，流动性变差.当温度逐渐升高时，水炭浆的表观黏度呈现出先降低后增加的趋势.

ABSTRACT：This paper investigated the effect of particle size distribution, slurry stirring and ambient temperature on the properties of coke water slurry, which was prepared by blue-coke fines in Northern Shaanxi. The blue-coke samples were ground with a laboratory size ball mill, and the particles were screened and separated into the following size range: ＞320 mesh(D1), 320 mesh-200 mesh(D2), 200 mesh-120 mesh(D3), 120 mesh-60 mesh(D4). The results indicated that the optimum conditions for the preparation of coke water slurry were as following: the granularity ratio (D1∶D2∶D3∶D4) is 5∶2∶2∶1; the stirring speed is 1 500 r/min; the stirring time is 15 min; the surrounding temperature at a range of 30 ℃ to 40 ℃. Under conditions above the slurry could keep its stability for one month long and show good fluidity, the mass fraction reached 60% and the apparent viscosity could reach 360 mPa·s. When adding fine-grained blue-coke particles, the apparent viscosity improved, fluidity reduced, and the stability reinforced. Excessive agitation had a contrary influence on the pulp, which would lead to poor fluidity and aging slurry. Along with the increase of temperature, apparent viscosity of coke water slurry decreased firstly and then rose up, as a result, got the minimum value(360 mPa·s) in the range of 30 ℃ to 40 ℃.

ABSTRACT：In this study, three different biomass including pine sawdust, peanut shell and straw combined with the coking coal were carbonized in fixed bed reactor. The mass fraction of biomass was 0%, 3%, 6%, 9% and 12%, respectively. The experimental results indicated that the mass fraction of pine sawdust, peanut shells and straw increased from 0% to 12%, the yield of char reduced from 75.39% to 66.29%, 68.40% and 67.39% respectively. At the same time, the yield of tar increased from 6.88% to 12.98%, 12.16% and 11.42%. As for gas, the yield improved from 13.64% to 15.63%, 15.27% and 16.97%. Moreover, there is a deviation between experimental value and calculated value of the co-carbonization product yield. Hence, it can be concluded that synergetic effect was occurred during the co-carbonization process. When biomass was added into coking coal, the content of CO and CO2 in coke gas was improved, while the H2 and CH4 were decreased.

ABSTRACT：Soda residue was added to Lüjiatuo coking coal with different blending ratios and cokes were then prepared from these blended coal samples. The thermal properties of these cokes at different reaction temperatures (850 ℃-1 200 ℃) were investigated. The results show that the addition of soda residue enhances coke reactivity and lowers the starting temperature of solution loss reaction of coke. The carbon loss amount at the maximum of surface area of coke after reaction increases with the increase of adding amount of soda residue, which shows that addition of soda residue increases the active points of solution loss reaction of coke; the SEM study shows that addition of  soda residue has little effect on the micro-morphology of coke before reaction. However, soda residue can promote the solution loss of coke surface, control the solution loss of internal coke, which would slow down the degradation of cokes.

ABSTRACT：A dynamic reactivity of particulate coke analyzer was described. Mathematical models for the solution loss rate and the dynamic reactivity of particulate coke were derived from the CO2 content in the exhaust after reaction. Two kinds of industrial cokes with different reactivity were selected to carry out the solution loss reaction test. The relative standard deviation of the reactivity index of particulate coke (PRI) is less than 0.5%. The relative error of PRI derived from the mathematical model is less than 1%. The chemical reaction control, mixed control and internal diffusion control during the solution loss reaction process were verified through the solution loss rate curves of cokes. And the characteristics of the solution loss reaction of two kinds of industrial cokes were identified using the mathematical model. The analysis of solution loss rate of coke revealed the relationship between the coke reactivity index (CRI) and reactivity index of particle coke (PRI).

摘要：以煤矸石和沥青为主要原料制备X沸石/活性炭型体复合材料，并以酚醛树脂作为沉积剂，研究碳沉积对复合材料的孔结构及CH4和N2吸附分离性能的影响.X射线衍射、低温N2吸附/脱附和273 K下CO2的吸附等温线表征结果表明，酚醛树脂可通过碳沉积的形式对复合材料中活性炭的微孔结构进行精细调节，随着碳沉积次数增加，微孔比表面积和微孔孔容降低，但其中0.45 nm~0.55 nm的微孔相对含量增加，微孔分布更加均一.复合材料在298 K下对CH4和N2的吸附等温线测试结果表明，虽然碳沉积使得CH4和N2吸附容量降低，但CH4/N2分离比提高至2.7.

ABSTRACT：In order to investigate the characteristics of microwave pyrolysis of Shenmu coal(SM) under CH4 atmosphere in a fixed bed reactor, the char of SM was added to the raw coal as the microwave absorbent and catalyst CH4 decomposition, the formation and distribution of products in the process of microwave pyrolysis of coal-char mixture(CCM) at various temperatures(450 ℃-700 ℃) under CH4 atmosphere were analyzed and compared with that under N2 atmosphere at the same condition. The results showed that the char yield of CCM under CH4 atmosphere was lower than that under N2 atmosphere; however, microwave pyrolysis of coal under CH4 atmosphere had higher tar and water yield than that under N2 atmosphere. Under CH4 atmosphere, the CCM had higher H2 and CO yield but less CO2 yield compared with N2 atmosphere. In the comprehensive comparison of the generation and distribution of microwave pyrolysis products between the two kinds of atmosphere, it could prove that coal pyrolysis could be hedrogenated by CH4 directly with the help of char’s catalytic effect on CH4 decomposition.

ABSTRACT：The pyrolysis experiments were carried out on lignite and biomass. The char characteristics, such as yield, proximate components, calorific value and surface texture were studied under the condition of different pyrolysis temperature and mixture ratio of lignite and biomass. Results showed that these characteristics of char were influenced by the ratio of biomass and pyrolysis temperature in a complicate way during the process of flash pyrolysis, due to the constitute and character of lignite and biomass. But the overall trend was that high char yield and calorific value could be got and ash content in char reduced through controlling suitable pyrolysis temperature and suitable biomass ratio (the ratio less than 50%).  When the biomass blending ratio was 50%, the pyrolysis temperature was 600 ℃, the char yield of pyrolysis products was 52.1%, and the heating value of char was 23.75 MJ/Kg. Compared with single pyrolysis of lignite, surface texture of char were improved by adding biomass, and pore of char increased, which were benefit to increase adsorbability and reactiveness.

ABSTRACT：In order to obtain the feasibility of in-situ CO2 gasification of high moisture content lignite. A moving bed tubular experimental reactor, which used for the in-situ CO2 gasification of undriedlignite, was built. The effects of temperature and CO2 flow rate on the product yield, gas composition, low heating value of gas and other evaluations for gasification were investigated. Experimental results showed that the gasification of lignite with in-situ steam and CO2 was carried out simultaneously. As the CO2 flow rate was 1.1 L/min, the gas yield and carbon conversion rate heightened significantly with the increase of gasification temperature. The increase of CO2 flow rate enhanced CO2 gasification of the nascent char, which increased the gas yield and carbon conversation rate and the gas total calorific value also increased accordingly. The experimental results proved that high moisture content lignite in-situ CO2 gasification process is an effective methodology for the clean and efficient utilization of lignite.

ABSTRACT：The physic-chemical properties of coal direct liquefaction residues (DLR) was studied, and the production behaviors of liquid phase products during the pyrolysis of DLR at 300 ℃-425 ℃ was also investigated. The results showed that the n-hexane soluble (HS) content of DLR was up to 40.45% and the asphaltene content was 24.14%. Compared with the DLR through reduced pressure distillation, the DLR contained more HS and fewer asphaltene. The HS of DLR was mainly composed of 1-4 ring arenes and kinds of heteroatomic compounds like phenol, anthraquinone, ester and carbazole, and the content of aliphatic hydrocarbon was rather low. When the pyrolysis temperatures were 400 ℃ and 425 ℃, the yield of HS was 7.61% and 10.10% higher than that of HS in DLR, which meant that most of the asphaltene transformed into HS with small molecules under the conditions of this paper. It indicates that low temperature pyrolysis is a feasible and economic method to realize the high value-added utilization of DLR.

The coal liquefaction catalytic performances of the modified catalysts were evaluated in a 500 mL autoclave using Shendong coal. The results showed that the crystalline phases changed from α-FeOOH and γ-FeOOH to amorphous ferrihydrite (6-line) along with the amount of Si increasing. The aggregation was detected when the catalyst was doped with more than 5%Si. The modification by Si didn’t change the decomposition temperatures of FeOOH phases, but could reduce the weight loss in TG tests. Al could substitute with Fe to form Al-substituted FexAl1-xOOH, while increasing the decomposition temperatures of FeOOH phases in TG-DTG tests. The direct coal liquefaction results showed that Si and Al modified catalysts maintained the high coal conversion, reduced the H2 consumption and promoted the asphalt converting to oil thus improved the oil yield. The optimal amount of Si and Al was 5% and 10%-15%, respectively.

摘要：将焦炭在惰性气氛保护下，分别经1 100 ℃，1 200 ℃，1 300 ℃，1 450 ℃，1 600 ℃和1 800 ℃六个温度加热处理，考察了表面形貌、微孔结构及灰分含量的变化情况.结果发现，微孔结构及灰分含量的变化与加热温度密切相关，而且孔结构与灰分的析出逸出有较大的关联性.随着加热温度的升高，焦炭灰分不断析出到焦炭表面，在1 300 ℃焦炭表面灰分量最大；其后灰分开始逸出焦炭，灰分含量不断下降，并随着温度的升高而加速；焦炭的微孔体积和比表面积则呈现出先略有下降，然后升高，再大幅升高的特征.

ABSTRACT：The surface mophology, micropore structure and ash content of coke were studied after heat-treatment at 1 100 ℃, 1 200 ℃, 1 300 ℃, 1 450 ℃, 1 600 ℃ and 1 800 ℃. The results showed that the changes of micopore structure and ash content were greatly related to that of treating temperatures. With the increasing of heat-treatment temperature, ashes continuously dissolved to the surface of cokes, which reached the most amount at 1 300 ℃. When the treating temperature exceeded 1 300 ℃, ashes began to escape from coke, which resulted in the decling of ash content. And the ash content decreasing began to accelerate under higher temperature. The volumes and BET surfaces of micropores decreased first, then increased slowly and finally increased fastly to a bigger magnitude.

ABSTRACT：The vitrinite of 6 kinds of coking coals were enriched in order to describe the relative active quality difference of different ranks coking coals more accurately. The relationship between the caking index (G values) of different degrees of metamorphic coking coals and the vitrinite contents was investigated. The results showed that G values were increased with the increase of the vitrinite contents and it showed a significant linear relationship. The reciprocal of the slope (1/k) and Y intercept (y0) by fitting the linear equation could be used as new indexes to evaluate the activity quality of vitrinite. These indexes fitting by Gauss curve model could describe accurately the change rules of coking coal vitrinite activity quality with the increase of the average maximum reflectance of vitrinite.

ABSTRACT：A series of air-blown pitches with different softening points were prepared from the refined coal tar. The air-blown pitches and the refined coal tar were analyzed by 1H-NMR, elemental analysis, group composition, ash and true density measurement. The results show that the air blowing promotes the dehydrogenative condensation reaction and the cross-linking reaction. As changing the oxidation level, the softening point, composition and structure of the air-blown pitches changes. Calcined coke can be produced by the pyrolysis of the air-blown pitches. The good quality isotropic coke could be prepared by selection of suitable air-blown pitches as raw materials.

ABSTRACT：The fluorescence parameters (IF,max, IF,450, IF,470) for 13 kinds of coking coals with different coal ranks were determined using the three-dimensional scanning fluorescence spectroscopy. The relationships between fluorescence parameters and caking properties (caking index G, Gieseler fluidity lgα and Audibert-Arnu dilatometer b) were analyzed. The results show that IF,max, IF,450 and IF,470 have little difference with the increase of G (G<90), and increase linearly with the increase of G (G>90). The relationship of these fluorescence parameters with the fluidity is similar with G, and the turning point is lgα=3.0. Therefore, the fluorescence parameters are new index to evaluate the caking properties for the strongly caking coals. The fluorescence parameters first increase then decrease with the increase of b and the maximum is 195%.

ABSTRACT：The phenol adsorption of active coke from lignite was investigated. The cokes from the pyrolysis of lignite under different preparation conditions were activated with the agency of steam in a quartz fixed bed. The phenol adsorption experiments were conducted with cokes from different preparation conditions and after that the iodine value as well as the methylene blue adsorbance was achieved according to the national standards. The results indicated that proper preparation conditions were reasonable for active coke phenol adsorption. The steam flow could enhance the number of micropores and mesopores equally while the other two factors tend to singly change the number of micropores and mesopores. The best condition for the preparation of activated coke was found at temperature of 800 ℃, activation time of 80 min and steam flow of 8 g/h. In that case, the phenol adsorbance could reach 13.8 mg/g.
